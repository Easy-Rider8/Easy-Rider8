Hello!
ðŸ‘‹ I'm Easy-Rider8, a Software Test Engineer. I am currently focused on honing my skills in Python, Selenium, and Behave for test automation. Additionally, I have projects in JavaScript and PHP.

ðŸš€ Projects I'm actively working on:
  - Python Selenium Behave Project: I am developing a project to gain experience in test automation. I use Behave to create sample scenarios and automate tests.
  - JavaScript Projects: I am actively involved in various projects using JavaScript, ranging from browser-based applications to data analysis.
  - PHP Web Applications: I develop web applications using PHP. I have experience in areas such as database integration and user interface development.
You can find these projects and more on my GitHub profile. I'm open to any feedback and collaboration suggestions. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work together or exchange ideas on projects!

ðŸ“« You can send me a message on GitHub.

Thanks, and happy coding! ðŸš€
